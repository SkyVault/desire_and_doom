FIXES:
-- Fix the glitch with the hulls ghosting

-- Make it so that the player slides against the tangent of the line
-- Improve how the game scales with the window size
-- Dont hardcode the combo frame
-- Improve the particle system to suck less
-- Create a button mapping system
-- Improve the Assets system, make it auto load everything at startup

ADDITIONS

-- A* Path finding, implementing it in the AI_System class, already started

-- Input manager
	-- Input manager should eventually read from a keybindings menu and set the keys to that
	-- Input manager should handle joysticks and GamePad buttons.

	-- Make it render text and allow editing, modal vim based?

-- Equipment
	
DONE
-- Fix the dialog system
-- Remove that shitty table based ai system, implemented in AI_System
-- All of the menus in the game use different code to controll the interface

-- flags hit box is off center -- DONE
-- players claymore facing right hitbox is off center -- DONE

-- Make the invatory controllable with the gamepad	--DONE
-- The asset manager shouldn't crash when it cant find an object

:: NOTE :: Fixed this by drawing each map layer to a render target first, then rendering that in order with the regular scene.
-- Scale the whole game to prevent the OpenGL / DirectX oversampling :(
